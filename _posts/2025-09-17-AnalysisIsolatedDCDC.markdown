A hybrid distribution transformer combines a conventional distribution transformer with a partial power electronics stage, enabling medium-to-low voltage conversion. The power converters are used to provide voltage regulation and current compensation, such as mitigating load current harmonics and unbalances.

There are multiple hybrid distribution transformer configurations. Some of them require intermediate isolated DC/DC stages to decouple the power converter ends.

In this project, the student will:
- Analyze selected isolated DC/DC converter topologies.
- Simulate the isolated DC/DC converters in PLECS under open-loop and closed-loop operation.
- Integrate a selected number of isolated DC/DC converters into a hybrid distribution transformer model and validate their operation.
