A core component in battery chargers is the DC/DC converter, which ensures proper voltage regulation, current control, and protection during the charging process. Two main approaches are typically considered:
- Full power DC/DC converters: The entire charging power flows through the converter.
- Partial power DC/DC converters: Only a fraction of the power is processed by the converter, while the remaining power is directly transferred without conversion.

Partial power processing has the potential to reduce converter size, losses, and cost. However, it introduces additional design complexity and control challenges.

The objectives of this work are:
- Conduct a state-of-the-art review of full power and partial power DC/DC converter topologies for battery charging.
- Develop mathematical models of selected converter topologies.
- Simulate the converters under different operating conditions, including constant-current/constant-voltage charging and load variations.
- Evaluate performance metrics such as efficiency, power density, cost implications, and control complexity.
