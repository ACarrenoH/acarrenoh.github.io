A hybrid distribution transformer interconnects the medium-voltage and low-voltage grids. The DC-link of the power converter can additionally be employed to connect to a low-voltage DC microgrid, extending the capabilities of the hybrid distribution transformer.
The objective of this work is to adapt a conventional hybrid distribution transformer to enable the connection to a bipolar DC microgrid. In this project, the student will:
- Modify a hybrid distribution transformer by selecting a suitable power converter topology to allow bipolar DC microgrid integration.
- Model and design a control strategy for the proposed hybrid distribution transformer.
- Simulate the proposed system using PLECS.
